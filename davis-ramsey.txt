Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline elements do not force a new line to begin while block elements typically do.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    the element's position on the screen will not change to make room for other elements. if height/width is set to auto the element is sized so the content fits. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    using display: inline-block
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    <p>, <form>,<table> are display block by default. <a>, <img> are display inline by default. <input> is displayin inline-block by default.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model decides how elements are sized. The problem is you have to take into account padding, border, and margin on top of whatever height/width you've assigned.
    The fix is using box-sizing: border-box, which will make all child elements respect their given width.
